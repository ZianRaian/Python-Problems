Given a string of lowercase English letters and an integer of the sub-string length, determine the sub-string of that length that contains the most. Vowels are in the set ( a, e, i, o, u). If there are no vowels in the input string, return the string 'Not found!' without quotes. 

Example 1: 
s= 'caberqiitefg'
k= 5
The substring of length k=5 that contains the maximum number of vowels is 'erquii' wih 3 vowels. The final answer is 'erqii'

Example 2:
s= 'aeiouia'
k=3
All of the characters are vowels, so any substring of length 3 will have 3 vowels. The lowes index sub-string is at index 0, 'aei'.

Function description:
Complete the function findSubsting , findSubstring has the following parameters:
s: a string
k: an integer
Returns:
string:  a string containing the final answer


Constraints:
1) 1 <= length(s) <= 2*10^5
2) 1 <= k <= length(s)

Input format for testing:
The first line contains a string, s. 
The second line conatins an integer k.


############## Solution Approach ################
1)Initialize a window of length k and count the vowels.
2)Slide the window across s, updating the vowel count in O(1) time.
3)Keep track of the substring with the most vowels.
4)Return the first such substring if there are multiple with the same count.
5)If no vowels exist, return "Not found!".
